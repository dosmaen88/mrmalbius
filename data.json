I woke silghtly knocked out with my older brother and father gone. As I grow up I became Police Officer, I thought that was the only way to stop whatever happened to me happen to another family. My real farther also was lost back in the town over 9 years ago, I have been searching for him and my long lost brother Drogun Vargon. Lately the DarkPressit have been attacking SPARK Corp. building because of SPARK Corp's fuel PHOENIX which is the only way to ensure the survivel of the human race because all other fuels have ran out but PHOENIX is a unstable subtance which can cause more harm than any fossil fuel."
